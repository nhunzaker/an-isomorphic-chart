# An Isomorphic Chart

Data visualization has become a more frequent element of our work at Viget. Be it simple pie charts or beautiful maps displaying jersey sales, visually representing data in a compelling way is a great device for storytelling and provides rich fuel for social sharing.

# Run it locally

After making sure you have `node 0.10.x`, open up a terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -d
npm start
```

Next, create a new terminal window or tab and run the following to
compile assets:

```bash
npm run watch
```

Don't forget this step, it's easy to miss when everything renders in
both the browser and on the server!
